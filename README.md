# Movie-success
This project has been done by Wang Jun and Da Costa Fernandes David Joaquim

The purpose of the project is to suggest an answer to the question "Can we predict wether a movie will be popular based on specific features like genre, budget, release date and reviews on other movies"

In the repository, there are 3 files: 

1. The jupiter notebook used to create the database: Data collection.ipynb
2. The database: MovieDB_complete.csv
3. The jupyter notebook with the other parts of the project (data cleaning, graphical representation,..): Main(KO).ipynb

Each notebook are independant componant, the main file can be runned without going throught all the data collection section. (reimport the csv database created from the data collection). Also, explanation are included within each file (expect the database).

The data used in this project are not our intellectual propriety and the purpose of the project is entirely educational.
